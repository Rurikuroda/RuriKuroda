            I like to take a photo that is subject. <br>
            When I take a photo, I care very much about props, cloths and background. <br>
            As if you are alonein the world, I create my dream world every time.

                   <p>▲This photo is a couple who are lesbian. <br>
                       When we were high school students, somebody talked behind their back.
                       However, they didn't lose. Even though they are alone together. <br>
                       <br>
                       ◀I imaged a mismatch that school uniform and japanese shopping arcade on purpose. <br>
                        Hiding the face expressed weirdness.I chose a girl who is slender <br>
                        because I wanted to express weirdness more.

                   <p>▲I took this photo in New Caledonia.
                       I didn't need my skill because a model who is my sister is good at swinmming <br>
                       and sea was so awsome. <br>
                       The most difficult thing was what I don't swim. lol
